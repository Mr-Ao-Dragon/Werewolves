## I can't level up

Check out the Leveling [Wiki Page](./werewolf/leveling.md)

## Where/How can I equip accessories?

They can be equipped in the Vampirism Menu (`default keybinding: P`) in the 3 slots next to the player.  
These accessories are completely unrelated to other mods. 

## I can't eat food items

By default, all non-meat items should not be editable by werewolf player unless the [Not Meat?](./werewolf/skills#not-meat?) Skill

#### But my food item is a meat item

Then the item is not correctly declared. Check out [here](./configuration#meat-configuration) for a guide.
