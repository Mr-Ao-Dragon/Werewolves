## Configuration Files

Werewolves's configuration is split across several files:

- werewolves-client.toml (located in `.minecraft/config/`) for client specific options
- werewolves-common.toml (located in `.minecraft/config/`) for common options
- werewolves-server.toml (located in `<world-dir>/serverconfig/`) for gameplay options per world
- werewolves-balance.toml (located in `<world-dir>/serverconfig/`) for fine-tuning of the balancing per world

If you want to change the world specific options before creating a world, either to change world-generation or to change it for all created worlds, you can use the defaultconfigs folder. It is located in your .minecraft or server directory. Copy a server or balance config from an existing world to this folder and change the values as desired. It will be used for new worlds.

## Meat configuration

Because werewolf player are bound to eat meat items they may find themselves with items from other mods that can not be eaten.
This can be caused by a missing `isMeat` flag by the mod or a missing entry in the `cookedmeats` or `rawmeats` item tag.

To allow there items to be eaten anyway there are 4 options you could take:
1. add the item ids the `customRawMeatItems` or `customMeatItems` config options in the server config depending on the fact if it is a raw or cooked meat. (and optionally option 3)
2. add the item ids to the `rawmeats` or `cookedmeats` item tag via a datapack .(and optionally option 3)
3. contact us in the `w-chatroom` channel on the Vampirism [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/EYBe7rKKAQ) with the item ids, so we may add them for future releases.
4. contact the mod author of the item to mark the item as meat


## Permission
Using appropriate server mods/plugins certain actions can also be controlled with permissions.
See [Permissions](./Permissions)
