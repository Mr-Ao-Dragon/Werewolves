# Becoming a werewolf

when you fight werewolves you eventually get bitten by them which can result in getting the "Lupus Sanguinem" Effect with unlimited duration. Another way to obtain the effect is to interact with a Werewolf Tooth in you hand. You can get rid of the effect by drinking milk. But if you want to become a werewolf you must sleep and wake up to complete to transformation resulting in becoming a werewolf level 1.

# Ritual

to level up you need to place a stone altar with 4 stone altar fire bowls (in a 3 block radius).
You must lit the fire bowls with a torch or flint & steel.
After that you can insert liver & broken bones into the altar.
To start the ritual you must right click the altar with a torch or flint & steel

# Un-Werewolf

If you want to leave the werewolf faction you have to get a "Strange Injection" by right click on a werewolf with a "Empty Syringe" and then inject it to yourself at an injection table. The strange effect you receive cleanses you from being a werewolf after 100 seconds.
