## Becoming a werewolf

when you fight werewolves you eventually get bitten by them which can result in getting the [Lupus Sanguinem](../content/effects.mdx#lupus-sanguinem) Effect with unlimited duration. Another way to obtain the effect is to interact with a [Werewolf Tooth](../content/items.mdx#werewolf-tooth) in you hand. You can get rid of the effect by drinking milk. But if you want to become a werewolf you must sleep and wake up to complete to transformation resulting in becoming a werewolf level 1.

## Ritual

to level up you need to place a [Stone Altar](../content/blocks.mdx#stone-altar) with 4 [Stone Altar Fire Bowls](../content/blocks.mdx#stone-altar-fire-bowl) (in a 3 block radius).
You must lit the fire bowls with a torch or flint & steel.
After that you can insert [Liver](../content/items.mdx#liver) & [Cracked Bones](../content/items.mdx#cracked-bone) into the altar.
To start the ritual you must right-click the altar with Flint & Steel or a (Soul) Torch

## Un-Werewolf

If you want to leave the werewolf faction you have to get a [Strange Injection](../content/items.mdx#strange-injection) by right click on a werewolf with a [Empty Syringe](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism/wiki/Items#injection) and then inject it to yourself at an injection table. The strange effect you receive cleanses you from being a werewolf after 100 seconds.
